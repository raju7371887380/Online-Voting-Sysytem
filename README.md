# Online-Voting-System
The Online Voting System using Blockchain Technology is a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof platform designed to conduct elections over the internet. It leverages the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain to ensure that votes are recorded accurately, cannot be altered, and are fully verifiable by all participants.
Traditional voting systems (paper-based or electronic) often face problems like voter fraud, data manipulation, lack of transparency, and high operational cost. Blockchain technology provides a reliable solution to overcome these issues by ensuring trust, transparency, and security in the voting process.
